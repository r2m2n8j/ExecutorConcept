## Question

1. Use Java8 features to initialize an interface and give implementation for its method.
2. Java8 new features
3. What is Stream?
4. Difference between Stream and Collection in Java8:
5. default and static method in Java8
6. What are default functions, when they were introduced, benefit of introducing a default method?
7. What is the functional interface and mentioned the inbuilt functional interface?
8. Suppose 2 interface implementing in single class which having same default method. (Read interface Diamond Problem)
9. Why functional interface since we have interface? (For using Lambda method)
10. Write code on Interfaces? If one class implementation two interfaces having one Abstract method in this case is there any compiler error? If we provide implementation which version will get in implementation class?
